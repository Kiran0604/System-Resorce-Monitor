System Resource Monitor is a real-time monitoring tool to track system resources, offering insights into system performance. In this project, I have built a real-time monitor for CPU, memory, and disk usage, providing
insights into system resource consumption. I have implemented data retrieval and presentation functions for clear and efficient resource management. Designed a user-friendly interface to aid in troubleshooting,
performance optimization, and capacity planning.
